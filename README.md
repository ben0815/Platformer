# Platformer

## Game Options:
# 2D Game:
We can look at 2D game engines to be build a better looking and functioning game
* Cocoa 2d (C++)
* Unity (C#)
* Others but might be using a different language

We could continue with what we already built
* We would have to refactor most of the exisiting code to a better state. 
* It would look good on a resume to say you have built a game engine (which is basically what we are doing).

Game Types:
* Platformer
** Too many to make a list.
* Building, management, and simulation game
** Rimworld
** Prison Architect
** Factorio
* Roque-like
** Binding of Issac

There are other games we could do.

# 3D Game:
Expanding our current project to a 3D game engine would be possible. I would require a lot of work
learning how to build everything in a logical manner.

Using a game engine would be the best option.
* Cry Engine
* Unreal Engine
* Unity (C#)
* Others...
